# Basic layout for ML algorithm

- [ ] Step 1: Define the problem statement
- [ ] Step 2: Gather the data
- [ ] Step 3: Prepare data for consumption
  * Import necessary libraries
  * Load Data Modelling Libraries
  * Meet and Greet Data your data
  * The 4 C's of Data Cleaning: Correcting, Completing, Creating, and Converting
    * Correcting - Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs Ex: age 800yrs instead of 80
    * Completing - Treatment to missing values
    * Creating - Features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome.
    * Converting - deal with formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but datatype formats. Our categorical data imported as objects, which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations. For this dataset, we will convert object datatypes to categorical dummy variables.
- [ ] Step 4: Perform Exploratory Analysis with Statistics
- [ ] Step 5: Model Data
   - [ ] Evaluate Model Performance
   - [ ] Tune Model with Hyper-Parameters
   - [ ] Tune Model with Feature Selection
- [ ] Step 6: Validate and Implement
- [ ] Step 7: Optimize and Strategize
